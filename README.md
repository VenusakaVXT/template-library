# Template Library
The site contains 30 sample libraries made of reusable HTML, CSS & Javascript for front end developers.

In which, there are 5 libraries mainly made from CSS and 25 libraries made from Javascript.

# Why was this project born?
After learning about HTML, CSS & Javascript. In order to improve my skills further, I have set a challenge for myself that within 30 days (1 month) will have to do 30 projects made from HTML, CSS, Javascript. That is, at least 1 project per day.

And actually I exceeded the previous allotted time by 30 days but anyway I finished 30 projects that I had planned earlier.

Let's take a look at 30 projects that I have done below.

# HTML, CSS:
- Program Language Book
- Compass
- Daily Goals
- Loading Animation
- Button Interfaces

# HTML, CSS & Javascript:
- Modal
- Product Card
- Image Gallery
- Search Box
- Detect Press Key
- Search Tags
- Form Validation
- Weather App
- Toast Message
- Brightness Slider
- Preview Image
- Search Product
- Page Scroll
- Counter Follows
- Drag And Drop
- Drawing App
- Zoom Image
- Hover Board
- Tabs UI
- Light/Dark Mode
- Todo List
- Skeleton Loading Effect
- Play Piano
- Simple Carousel
- Custom Video Player

# Note
In the Weather App section, I have requested the API until now, it is no longer supported by browsers, so when you download it, you can request another API, by going online to search **weather app api** or maybe refer to this https://openweathermap.org/ website.

# Experiences Gained
I have mastered a lot of CSS properties such as: flex, animation, transform, ....

As for Javascript is a language that I love very much. The results I achieved after working on the project are firmly grasping the knowledge of: Modal Design, Catching Events, Form Validator, Request API, Mock API, Local Storage, ....

# End README
In general, the functions in the project are the functions that frontend developers will have to use at least 1 or 2 times in their projects.

And I have also made the code simple and clear so that those who are new or have been programming for a long time can reuse it.
