This code uses the "input" event to listen for input into the search box and perform a search action on the product list. When a user types a keyword into the search box, the variable `txtSearch` stores the contents of the search box (converted to lower case and spaces removed).

The next code gets the list of products using `querySelectorAll` and stores them in the variable `listProductDOM`.

Then, for each product in the product list, this code takes the product name and price and stores it in a variable, to be used in the search.

The variables `highlightedName` and `highlightedPrice` will be used to replace the text found by highlighting the search results, using `replace` in JavaScript to replace all text matching the word search key `txtSearch`.

Use the syntax `new RegExp(txtSearch, 'gi')` to create a regular expression for searching keywords in text. This regular expression uses the 'g' and 'i' parameters to search the entire string and is case insensitive.

Finally, for each product, if the product name or product price contains the search keyword, that product will be displayed on the website and vice versa.

In short, my code searches through the list of products and highlights them with braille and hides or shows the products depending on the search results. The regular expression `RegExp` is used to search for search keywords in the text and replace them with braille to highlight the search results.

To better understand the regular expression I use, you can read the content of the 2 urls below to understand better.
